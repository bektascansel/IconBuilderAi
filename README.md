## Project Architecture
IconBuilderAI is structured according to Clean Architecture and CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) principles. This architecture enhances the scalability and maintainability of the application.

- **Clean Architecture:** Ensures that the project is structured in independent modules, allowing each module to be developed and tested independently of the others.
- **CQRS:** Separates command and query operations, enabling more efficient and scalable management of both processes.
